            EECU budget calculator: This website was designed to be a budget
            calculator that factors in taxes, insurance cost and more. Using
            JavaScript, this website is capable of calculating monthly pay using
            only the users yearly salary. This is then used to budget payments
            and displays how much money would be left afterwards. The website
            was made in VScode and uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was in
            this project that I learned how to work with JavaScript. The website
            was a success in the fact that it was able to do calculations and
            display the results, however, there were many challenges.This
            included the sizing of areas and certain parts of the JS. These
            challenges were overcome by myself and my partner on the project. We
            collaborated on this project and communicated our ideas and how to
            solve the problems we had with coding.

            DelveHomes: This was my first major coding project. It was created
            in VSCode and only uses CSS and HTML. The website was created to
            sell homes that were featured in Ray Bradburyâ€™s short story, The
            Machine Stops, which tells the story of a dystopian world where
            everyone lives underground in small, hexagon shaped homes with
            advanced technology. The website is made up of multiple pages with
            different images and information on the homes, one of these pages
            has a form that can be filled out by users. The HTML of the site was
            used to add and format the content, while the CSS was used to add
            color and positioning to the content. This project was also
            completed with the help of a partner. We each worked on our own
            pages, and after we finished, we looked over each other's work for
            any errors. One of the biggest challenges with this website was the
            form on the tour page. The form would not size properly and would be
            off to the wrong side. In the end, the website was a success and
            this problem was solved. We persisted on the website until it was as
            good as possible.
