            Cartkour Game: This was my first time working in GDevelop which is a simple 
            game design website. The game needed to be a platformer game involving CART, 
            but everything else was up to me. This means I could choose the 
            characters, the animations, the music, and more.

            Jurassic Park: This was the first big project that we did as a class. We all read the novel 
            Jurassic Park and had to make a game based on it. We had almost full creative liberty
            with what the game was about and how it worked. The game I worked on was a
            2D platformer where the main character was a velociraptor. The goal of the game 
            was to avoid or attack enemies and get to the end of each level. I personally did most
            of the soundtrack for the game, including some of the sound effects.
