            Hobbies: In my spare time I like to play video games and relax at
            home. I play a variety of game genres from platformers, FPS, and
            adventure games. This hobby has played a big part in my life and has
            inspired me to pursue it as a career. For as long as I could
            remember I have wanted to work in game development in some way. This
            could be programming, working on the art for them or even doing the
            music.

            Other interests: Along with playing video games, I also enjoy
            comics, art, and music. I have always been a fan of comic books and
            most superhero media, including games, movies, and the books
            themselves. As for art, I enjoy making pixel art and pencil drawing
            in my free time. One of my favorite pieces can be seen on the right.
            More of my art can be seen on the personal projects page using this
            link here. Aside from comics and art, I also make music at times. I
            tend to focus on other hobbies more than music, because I tend to
            make it when I have nothing else to do. With that being said, I
            still enjoy all of these interests and hobbies.
