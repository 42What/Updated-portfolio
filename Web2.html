            Candy Land: This is my most recent project, and also my favorite.
            The site uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with the art being made in
            a pixel art program. The website was created as a new version of the
            board game Candy Land, which used dice and had randomly generated
            events. As with my other projects, this one was made with a partner.
            I learned more about hot make art for a project, before this I just
            used royalty free images for my websites. This project also taught
            me more about using JavaScript and all of the uses it has. The board
            itself was created with a CSS grid layout, while the dice and player
            mechanics were created using javascript. This project was made
            possible through the communication of ideas with my partner along
            with our knowledge of programming. The website as a whole was
            successful, as it was a playable version of Candy Land. Programming
            the game came with some challenges, however. One of the main
            challenges was making the player models move according to the dice
            roll. We persisted and overcame this challenge and the result was a
            finished and functional game.

            Energy Crisis Website: This website’s purpose is to inform about the
            ongoing energy problem that the world is facing.The site provides
            information on different forms of energy such as solar, wind, and
            hydroelectric power. When it was being made everyone in the class
            took turns working on different projects, meaning that I would work
            on someone else's project, then they would work on mine. This was a
            way to learn more communication skills and how to work with a team
            on a programming project. The website itself was created in VScode
            and used HTML and CSS. The main challenge of this website was
            collaborating with other people and getting my ideas across so they
            could be completed how I wanted them. This led to success, however,
            as we were able to talk about how things should be resulting in a
            website that did what it set out to do, and more thanks to the other
            team members’ input.
