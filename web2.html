            Food Fight Game: This was another game made in GDevelop. This one needed to be related
            to the theme of a food fight. In my game you play as a sentient pile of cookie 
            dough. The player must progress through the world while attacking enemies and jumping over 
            obstacles. This game is meant as a new installment in a franchise that started
            with a board game that was made in another class.

            Beowulf Game: After reading the poem Beowulf, myself and a team of
            two others worked on a game based on the story. In the game we play as Wiglaf and
            must survive three nights in different areas. Beowulf is able to
            block one door at a time to prevent monsters from attacking the player.
