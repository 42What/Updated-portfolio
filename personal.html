          This piece, titled The Planet, was created during my time at The
          Center for Advanced Research and Technology. During the production of
          this website, a friend of mine was working on a project and needed
          designs for planets. I Decided to help and the result was the
          following image. I started making pixel art in September of 2022 for
          fun. These skills have been used for my board game website, and now,
          this website as well. This drawing takes inspiration from my other
          hobbies such as video games and comics along with my preference of
          colors.

        This artwork was created for the candy land board game project, but was
        sadly never used. This was meant to be a background image for the board,
        but was scrapped for the use of a CSS grid layout. After the project
        finished, the picture was left to collect dust, as it was no longer
        needed. That is until now. I chose this piece because I enjoyed creating
        it and I didnâ€™t want this work to go to waste.
