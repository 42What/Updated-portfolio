            This is a sample of the text used on the Delve Homes project. This
            project used the E. M. Forster short story, The Machine Stops, to
            tell a dystopian tale about the future of humanity. This creative
            writing was used to depict a futuristic home which was being sold on
            the website I created and can be found within this site. In this
            writing I learned more about using third person voice and how to
            persuade people using writing. The reason I selected this piece of
            writing, was because I enjoy how I was able to creatively express
            how this idea could work realistically.

          This was the start of a persuasive essay on going into programming as
          a career. In this essay, I talked about my past experiences with
          coding and how it was something that I enjoyed doing. The essay taught
          me about using first person voice in a professional piece writing,
          that was still effective. It was during the writing process of this,
          that I learned more about programming as a career and what paths it
          could lead to. I chose this sample because it helped to show me how
          far I could go in the programming world.
